This project, written with Laravel 10, utilizes features such as policy, factory, seeder, event, listeners, and middleware. Additionally, it makes use of packages like Breeze and Telescope. The models in this application are of type many-to-many. This website is built using PHP language. Furthermore, ultimately, I ensured the correctness and efficiency of the application using HTTP testing and database testing.
